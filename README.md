# Project : RAG

The goal of this project is to create a simple LLMs based RAG module. Obviously the most complex part is how to correctly link all components. We let you free to create your own database. Anything can be ragged, from research paper, songs, subtitles, books,...

This project is voluntarly sparsely helped, as, as engineers, you will dig into lots of existing method, and will need to pick the best one up. We want you to get familiar with the engineering world.

We will give you some recommendations. You will see lots of issues during this project, some you've already seen during Labs, other that are new. So buckle up, read the docs, and RAG your data.

Obviously there are lots of tutorials of the internet that you could just copy paste to get a baseline.


## **We encourage you to do code versioning using Github.**


**Ideal Project Timeline:**

*   Talking and getting to know the Modules. Discussing about the choice of your LLMs and the environment you'll have. Choosing a first set of data to RAG. Setting up your Github (Optional) (1h)
*   Setting up your first RAG Chain using Langchain or other (2-3h)
*   Understand the limitation of your RAG and find enhancements to set up your 2nd RAG. (2h)
*   Unveiling the unknown document, adapt your RAGs (2h)
*   Deploy it (Optional)
*   Begin your presentation (2h)
*   Presentation (5 min/groups)
